PhxMaps
===========

This project is meant to give Open WebOS an alternative for the stock bing maps application. PhxMaps is based on Google Maps Java Script API v3 and enyojs 2.0.

Here is the Roadmap (e= early, m = mid, e=end) :

P1:

- [done] location via html5 (a0912)

P2:

- [inprogress] check for connectivity and add loading animation (m0912)
- [done] traffic overlay (a0912)
- [inprogress] directions (by foot, car and public transfer if available) (e0912)
- [inprogress] display all search results if more then one is available or if none is found (e0912)

--- after this my holidays will be over. Can't estimate yet when I will reach the other goals alone ---

P3:

- [done] traffic layer (a0912)
- [done] transit layer (a0912)
- [done] bicycle layer
- when more then one search result is found, all results should be marked
- determining the correct zoom level
- markers should be removed when a new search is executed
- planning routes with more then one target
- bookmarks
- point of interest (like restaurants, stores â€¦.)
- clean interface (remove zoom buttons, and overlay buttons)
- search for good clean icons
